          {"\n"}A statement that the complaining party has a good faith belief

          Removal of Allegedly Infringing Material. Once a proper infringement
          notice is received by the Designated Agent, we may remove or disable
          access to the allegedly infringing material. We will make reasonable
          attempts to notify the User that we have removed or disabled access to
          the material. We may terminate access to the Site to Users who are
          repeat offenders.

          Counter-Notice Procedure. If a User believes that their material that
          was removed or to which access was disabled is not infringing upon a
          copyright, that User must send a counter-notice to the Designated
          Agent, pursuant to 512(g)(2) and (3) of the Digital Millennium
          Copyright Act. The counter-notice must contain the following
          information:
          {"\n"}
          {"\n"}A physical or electronic signature of the User;
          {"\n"}
          {"\n"}
          The location at which the material appeared before it was removed or
          access to it was disabled;
          {"\n"}
          {"\n"}A statement under penalty of perjury that the User has a good
          faith belief that the material was removed or disabled because of
          mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or
          disabled;
          {"\n"}
          {"\n"}
          The User’s name, address, and telephone number, and a statement that
          the User consents to the jurisdiction of Federal District Court for
          the judicial district in which the address is located, or if the
          User’s address is outside of the United States, for any judicial
          district in which RMA may be found, and that the User will accept
          service of process from the person who provided notification under
          subsection (c)(1)(C) or an agent of such person.
          {"\n"}
          {"\n"}
          If a counter-notice is received by the Designated Agent, we may send a
          copy of the counter-notice to the original complaining party informing
          that person that we may replace the removed material or cease
          disabling it in 10 business days. Unless the copyright owner files an
          action seeking a court order against the User, the removed material
          may be replaced or access to it restored after receipt of the
          counter-notice in accordance with the DMCA.
